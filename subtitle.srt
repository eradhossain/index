If it's such like tha t tha n don't

803
01:43:22,529 --> 01:43:23,291
Wa s you there?

804
01:43:25,365 --> 01:43:25,831
No.

805
01:43:26,967 --> 01:43:29,231
It wa s my wedding da y for God Sa ke.

806
01:43:30,804 --> 01:43:35,605
The bea utiful da y of my life
a nd you destroyed it forever.

807
01:43:38,312 --> 01:43:40,439
I never sa w you kind
of person till toda y.

808
01:43:41,615 --> 01:43:44,379
You a re the worst kind of
huma n being ever possible.

809
01:43:46,453 --> 01:43:47,886
You don't know nothing.

810
01:43:50,357 --> 01:43:54,521
Now you a re a fra id of tha t
somebody else will come out like me.

811
01:43:55,295 --> 01:43:56,762
A nd a ga in brea ks your hea rt.

812
01:43:58,398 --> 01:44:03,267
So you brea k everybody before
he's going to brea k you.

813
01:44:05,372 --> 01:44:07,431
So you got the cha nce to put
down the world on to your knees.

814
01:44:08,609 --> 01:44:10,236
So you a re ta king benefit out of it.

815
01:44:11,612 --> 01:44:12,636
Don't do such like tha t.

816
01:44:12,946 --> 01:44:16,746
Plea se only ma n ca n suffer in it.

817
01:44:18,218 --> 01:44:19,310
Sta ys a Ione.

818
01:44:20,587 --> 01:44:21,952
And tha t is you, Ra dhika.

819
01:44:29,329 --> 01:44:30,694
And I'm not a Ione.

820
01:44:31,398 --> 01:44:32,797
I'm on top.

821
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:38,469
And the person who is on top
a s you put it, is powerful.

822
01:44:41,008 --> 01:44:43,374
This is my life a nd it's perfect.

823
01:44:44,011 --> 01:44:46,571
People love to die to live
the life of Shiriya Ra thod.

824
01:44:47,447 --> 01:44:53,511
Soft drinks compa nies offer... a long with
Shriya, like Sriya a nd spent a da y with Shiriya.

825
01:44:54,388 --> 01:44:55,922
You ca n't be cha nged
by cha nging your na me.

826
01:44:55,922 --> 01:44:56,911
Just shut up.

827
01:44:58,959 --> 01:45:01,393
Wha t you ha ve to do you did it.

828
01:45:02,229 --> 01:45:05,164
A nd you ca n't do a nything to remove it.

829
01:45:07,968 --> 01:45:09,401
Go from here Ra j.

830
01:45:11,705 --> 01:45:13,297
This ga me is over.

831
01:45:14,241 --> 01:45:16,471
Lea ve from here a nd
don't ever come ba ck.

832
01:45:17,911 --> 01:45:19,606
I'll never forgive you.

833
01:45:48,442 --> 01:45:51,411
Sa chin wa s right tha t isn't so ea sy.

834

Come a nd sa y sorry Ma 'a m.

835
01:45:56,350 --> 01:45:57,544
Why she forgive me?

836
01:45:58,418 --> 01:45:59,851
I ca n't even forgive myself.

837
01:46:08,428 --> 01:46:15,197
It ha s to be considered tha t wha t I ha ve done
with tha t girl if somebody did it with me tha n...

838
01:46:24,745 --> 01:46:27,270
Nobody hea rt me tha t much till toda y.

839
01:46:28,248 --> 01:46:29,510
Tha t much you did.

840
01:46:31,852 --> 01:46:36,653
And nobody did tha t much ha rd
work to correct his fa ult.

841
01:46:39,960 --> 01:46:40,949
I'm tired.

842
01:46:42,496 --> 01:46:44,657
To ha te you is my ha bit now.

843
01:46:45,732 --> 01:46:47,324
Apa rt of my life.

844
01:46:49,336 --> 01:46:55,297
Wherever I ca n go, on shootings,
shows, ma keup, recordings loca tions.

845
01:46:57,677 --> 01:47:00,510
I a Iwa ys sta y outside the
office of tha t registra r.

846
01:47:02,616 --> 01:47:04,777
I'm still hooked up in tha t 8th August.

847
01:47:08,889 --> 01:47:14,885
If toda y I ha ven't forgive you tha t ma y

848
01:47:28,475 --> 01:47:29,703
So you forgive me.

849
01:47:31,645 --> 01:47:34,205
Yes, I forgive you.

850
01:47:38,385 --> 01:47:41,252
Actua Ily I ha ve to sa y tha nk you.

851
01:47:43,423 --> 01:47:47,359
Nor you lea ve me or neither I
be a tha t much big sta r in a nger.

852
01:47:47,961 --> 01:47:49,451
Turn into Shriya from Ra dhika.

853
01:47:50,397 --> 01:47:55,425
And you'll not come on knees to
sa y forgive me... forgive me...

854
01:47:56,603 --> 01:47:58,662
So Shriya ca n't become Ra dhika.

855
01:47:59,873 --> 01:48:02,205
Sometimes a bit shock is being needed.

856
01:48:02,776 --> 01:48:04,368
To recognize our self.

857
01:48:06,279 --> 01:48:09,442
This is a different ma tter
tha t you give high shock.

858
01:48:12,352 --> 01:48:13,284
But I forgive you.

859
01:48:23,497 --> 01:48:24,521
I'll not go such like this.

860
01:48:34,908 --> 01:48:36,603
I'm very plea sed to hea r this.

861
01:48:40,447 --> 01:48:41,311
Me too.

862
01:48:44,317 --> 01:48:50,187
Sha II I sa y something, whoever
you like he must be a killer.

863
01:48:51,391 --> 01:48:52,187
I know.

864
01:48:53,460 --> 01:48:54,188
Ta ke ca re of yourself.

865
01:49:37,370 --> 01:49:37,768
I don't believe tha t wha t
I wa nt to do, I did it.

866
01:49:42,475 --> 01:49:44,204
Now I feel good inside.
